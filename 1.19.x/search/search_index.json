There you have multiple options. First the <code>spawns</code>: <pre><code>{\n\"spawns\": {\n\"default\": {\n\"east\": [],\n\"west\": [],\n\"north\": [],\n\"south\": [\n[ 6, 3, 5 ]\n]\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre> This option holds multiple objects. The key (here <code>default</code>) is important for the <code>templates</code> option in a next step. You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that no key can be used twice! The content of each object are the four directions as keys. These include an array of arrays. This array contains the spawn positions. The spawn positions  are formatted this way: <pre><code>[ x, y, z ]\n</code></pre></p> <p>Second, the <code>spreads</code>: <pre><code>{\n\"spreads\": {\n\"default\": [\n{\n\"file\": \"default.nbt\",\n\"minOffset\": [ -6, 3, 5 ],\n\"maxOffset\": [ 4, 10, 3 ],\n\"origin\": \"center\"\n},\n{\n\"file\": \"default2.nbt\",\n\"offset\": [0, 64, 0]\n}\n]\n}\n}\n</code></pre> This option is similar to the previously explained <code>spawns</code>. It holds multiple objects. The key (here <code>default</code>) is  important for the <code>templates</code> option in a next step. You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that no key can be used twice! The content of each object is an array with other objects. These objects require a <code>file</code> (file name of a file located in <code>config/skyblockbuilder/templates/spreads</code> and ends with <code>.nbt</code> or <code>.snbt</code>), and either <code>minOffset</code> and <code>maxOffset</code>, or just <code>offset</code> for an offset relative to the 0 0 0 position of the main island. If you choose  <code>minOffset</code> and <code>maxOffset</code>, it'll be randomly generated somewhere between. There is also an optional config for the <code>origin</code>. This defines where the offset should be calculated at. There are two possible values: </p> <ul> <li><code>zero</code> (default, if not defined) right</li> <li><code>center</code> left </li> </ul> <p>For debugging, the <code>/locate</code> command was extended with <code>spread</code>. With <code>/locate spread &lt;team&gt; &lt;spread&gt;</code>, you can get all the positions for this type of spread.</p> <p>Next, the <code>surroundingBlocks</code>: <pre><code>{\n\"surroundingBlocks\": {\n\"default\": [\n\"minecraft:stone\",\n\"minecraft:bedrock\"\n]\n}\n}\n</code></pre> This options holds multiple objects. The key (here <code>default</code>) is important for the <code>templates</code> option in the next step. You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that no key can be used twice! The content of each object is an array of resource locations for blocks. These blocks will be used to surround the template with these blocks, randomly selected. Look at the <code>surroundingMargin</code> in the next step for thickness.</p> <p>Now the <code>templates</code>: <pre><code>{\n\"templates\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"default\",\n\"desc\": \"Default template\",\n\"file\": \"default.nbt\",\n\"spawns\": \"default\",\n\"offset\": [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n\"surroundingBlocks\": \"default\",\n\"surroundingMargin\": 0\n}\n]\n}\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>The <code>name</code> is the name displayed in the <code>Customize</code> screen when selecting the world-preset. Use <code>{</code> at start and <code>}</code>   at the end to create a language key. That way, you can translate the name into other languages using a resource pack.</li> <li>The <code>desc</code> (optional - default \"\") is the description displayed in the <code>Customize</code> screen when selecting the world-type.   Use <code>{</code> at start and <code>}</code> at the end to create a language key. That way, you can translate the name into other   languages using a resource pack.</li> <li>The <code>file</code> is the name of the file for that template.</li> <li>The <code>spawns</code> is the spawn configuration name from the <code>spawns</code> option.</li> <li>The <code>direction</code> (optional - default \"south\") is the direction the user should look at for this template. If not    provided, it'll be <code>south</code>.</li> <li>The <code>offset</code> (optional - default [ 0, 0, 0 ]) is the offset for this specific template. Read    here more about the offset.
