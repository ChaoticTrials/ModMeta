# A SpookyJam 2020 mod!

This mod introduces a pumpkin used for crafting! It utilizes fluids and items to create other items, such as food.
Additionally, it features a refinery for obtaining specific fluids and special items.

Stems can be acquired by using a hoe. Recipes can be easily added through JSON files. Note that some recipes require
heat; the default heat values are provided [here](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/Cucurbita/wiki/Heat-Sources) until
there is an in-game display for them.
