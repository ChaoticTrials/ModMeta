This mod adds a few essential items for my modpack(s).
[Garden of Glass (Questbook Edition)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/garden-of-glass-questbook-edition)
Expert Mode will utilize this mod, increasing the difficulty of the modpack (if desired).

For newer packs, I have created a more modular mod called [Pack Essentials]({mod_hoster}pack-essentials). This is the
go-to mod for any pack beyond version 1.20.x.

## Content
- Mana Petals (RIP Botania build 238)
- Compressed Cobblestone
- ...more content will be added as needed

Please note that no recipes are included with this mod. You will need to add recipes yourself using
