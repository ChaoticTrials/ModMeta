The most epic mod made for [WinterJam 2020](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mmds-winterjam-2020). It
adds peed snow. This snow can spread onto normal snow (configurable) with the same speed of grass spreading. The 
duration you need to stand on a snow block to turn it into yellow snow is 5 seconds and can be changed in config.
Players are not able to pee on snow by default (configurable), but all monsters and animals.
Throwing a snowball will hurt on impact. The damage is 0.5 to 1 hearts, additional 2 hearts for blazes.

This mod is also compatible with [Naughty or Nice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/naughty-or-nice). 
Placing snow block (layer) will remove 0.01 niceness, breaking will add 0.005 points.
