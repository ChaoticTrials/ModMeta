Sometimes, it's difficult to find out what exactly is needed to complete advancements. This mod helps you to keep track,
and see dependencies for advancements, even if you can't see it in the advancements tab. You can search for it via 
[Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei).
