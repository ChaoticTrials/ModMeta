# Heracles
*The config values on this page can be found in `config/skyblockbuilder/heracles.json5` when 
[Heracles ðŸ”—](https://modrinth.com/mod/heracles) is installed*

## Reset Quest Progress
If this config is enabled, it will result in a quest progress reset when a player leaves a team, no matter in which way:
- being kicked
- leaving by themselves

This does not apply for players with permission level 2 or higher.

## Skip non-existing Spreads
If a player does not have a team, or the team does not have any spread, this config option can be used to complete these
tasks without the player needing to visit these spreads.
