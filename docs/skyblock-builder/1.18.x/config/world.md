# World
## Island distance
The distance between two islands. If you choose `the_nether` as [start dimension](spawn.md#dimension), it will be 
divided by 8.

## Offset
The offset from 0, 0 to generate the islands. Can be used to generate them in the middle of .mca files.

## Sea height
The sea level in the world. This has nothing to do with the water height in the world. This does affect the spawn height
of squids for example.

## Surface
The block settings for generating the different dimensions surfaces. It's in the same format as 
[flat world generation settings ðŸ”—](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Superflat#Preset_code_format), but will ignore
the biome. You can set it for each dimension. Instead of removing the dimension from the list, just set it to an empty
string to generate it completely void. If the surface is disabled, it will ignore the setting.

## Biomes
It's a map which provides [ResourceLists ðŸ”—](https://moddingx.org/libx/org/moddingx/libx/util/data/ResourceList.html#use_resource_lists_in_configs).
It's set to allow all biomes per default. You can deny biomes by adding them to the list. Setting `allow_list` to true
will only use the biomes in the list. Keep in mind that each dimension needs at least one valid biome!

A list with all possible structures can be found in `config/skyblockbuilder/data/biomes.txt`.
