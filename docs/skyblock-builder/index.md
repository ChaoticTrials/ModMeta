Welcome to the wiki page of the awesome Skyblock mod 
[Skyblock Builder](https://modrinth.com/mod/skyblock-builder) by MelanX. Use the left sidebar to 
browse everything. You could also use the search bar on top of the site to search for a special thing.

There are also examples provided for each version. There are also contained downloads which can be used as reference.
You may use them to look at the files to see the config, and look in game to see what this will change. The configs in
the download does **only** contain changes. Default values are not included in the downloads.

## You want to help improve the mod?

The easiest way to contribute is to report bugs and suggestions to [GitHub](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/SkyblockBuilder).

Another way is to translate the mod! For this, you could also use GitHub. This is the easiest way for me, and you will 
be marked as contributor on GitHub. Another way is to use [OneSky](https://oss5m9q.oneskyapp.com/admin/project/dashboard/project/177200).
This way, I will download the file once the language has more than 90% translated.
