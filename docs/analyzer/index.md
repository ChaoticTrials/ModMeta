**Analyzer** isn't maintained anymore.

It simply adds 5 commands, mainly made for [Bongo](https://modrinth.com/mod/bongo). This
feature was added by the mod itself, but made much better.

- `/analyzer items`
  - Prints all items in `config/analyzer/items.txt`

- `/analyzer entities`
  - Prints all monsters/animals in `config/analyzer/entities.txt`

- `/analyzer biomes`
  - Prints all biomes in `config/analyzer/biomes.txt`

- `/analyzer advancements`
  - Prints all advancements in `config/analyzer/advancements.txt`

- `/analyzer potions`
  - Prints all potion effects in `config/analyzer/potions.txt`

Example output:
```
...
minecraft:melon
minecraft:melon_seeds
minecraft:melon_slice
minecraft:milk_bucket
minecraft:minecart
...
```
