# MelanX's mods which will be ported to 1.21

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Recently, I'm struggling if I still want to create and maintain my mods. It's still fun and I think
that I will still maintain it, even for newer versions. Because of less motivation than before, some mods will take
longer than before. Please, still report any problems! I'm still trying to fix everything.

It's likely that I'm focussing on supporting [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/) only. I'm still unsure about supporting 
good old [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).

Stop asking when something is ready. It's ready when it's ready. You can keep track of the progress 
[here](https://melanx.github.io/Mod-Wikis/porting-information/1.21/). I might do things earlier than they are planned if 
I have to wait for my dependencies to be ported. The order of mods is alphabetically only. This is not the order in 
which mods will be ported.

All my mods in 1.17+ are also be available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/MelanX).

By releasing of 1.21, none of my mods will receive any updates for 1.19 and below anymore. Bug fixes will be provided
for 1.20 if necessary. Critical bugs will be fixed in 1.19 as well.

## Mods that won't be ported

These mods are not being ported to 1.21. At least not by me. Don't ask for them. If you really want them, learn modding
and do it yourself.
