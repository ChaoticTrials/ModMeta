# Order in which MelanX' mods are ported to 1.19

Stop asking when something is ready. It's ready when it's ready. You can keep track of the progress [here](https://melanx.github.io/Mod-Wikis/porting-information/1.19/).
I might do things earlier than they are planned if I have to wait for my dependencies to be ported.
The order of mods is alphabetically only. This is not the order in which mods will be ported.

All my mods in the [1.18 "Mods that won't be ported"](https://melanx.github.io/Mod-Wikis/porting-information/1.18/#mods-that-wont-be-ported)
list will not be ported to 1.19 either.

All my mods in 1.17+ are also be available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/MelanX).

By releasing of 1.19, none of my mods will receive any update for 1.17 and below anymore. Bug fixes will be provided
for 1.18 if necessary.

## Mods that won't be ported

These mods are not being ported to 1.19. At least not by me. Don't ask for them. If you really want them, learn modding
and do it yourself.
