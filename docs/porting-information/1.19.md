# Order in which MelanX' mods are ported from 1.18 to 1.19

Stop asking when something is ready. It's ready when it's ready. You can keep track of the progress here. I might do things earlier than they are planned if I have to wait for my dependencies to be ported.

All my mods which aren't even on 1.18 will not be ported, and thus they are not listed below.

All my mods in 1.17+ are also be available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/MelanX).

By releasing of 1.19, none of my mods will receive any update for 1.17 and below anymore. 1.18 will receive some bug fixes if it's necessary.

## Mods that won't be ported

These mods are not ported to 1.19. At least not by me. Don't ask for them. If you really want them, learn moddings and do it yourself.
