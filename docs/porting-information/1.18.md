# Order in which MelanX' mods are ported from 1.16+ to 1.18

Stop asking when something is ready. It's ready when it's ready. You can keep track of the progress here. I might do things earlier than they are planned if I have to wait for my dependencies to be ported.

For the information, which mods are not even on 1.17.1 and need to be ported from 1.16.x directly to 1.18, look at the [1.17 porting list](https://git.io/melanx117porting).

All my mods in 1.17+ will also be available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/BTS0hlQy).

## Mods that won't be ported

These mods are not ported to 1.18. At least not by me. Don't ask for them. If you really want them, learn moddings and do it yourself.
