# Spawn
## Dimension
This sets the dimension where you will spawn and the island be generated.

This can be any dimension found in `config/skyblockbuilder/data/dimensions.txt`. This file will **only** be generated
when joining a skyblock world.

## Height
### Range
You can set a range from `minY` to `maxY`. `minY` is the bottom spawn position. `maxY` is the top spawn dimension.
If you set the [spawn height type](#type) (see below) to `set`, the bottom value will be used for a set height.
Otherwise, the height will be calculated.

### Type
`set`: This is a fixed spawn position. For users of the older versions of skyblock builder, this is the normal mode as
before. It will use the `bottom` value of the [range](#range) as fixed height. The `top` value will be ignored.

`range_top`: This will search for a valid position beginning at the `top` position, down to the `bottom`. If no valid
spawn was found, it uses the `top` value as fixed height.

`range_bottom`: Same as `range_top`. The only difference is that it uses the `bottom` value as fixed height if there was
no valid spawn found.

Valid spawns are defined as: Two block air on top of each other. Under that, it's a normal block/slab, or block inside
the valid spawn [block tag ðŸ”—](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack#Tags)
`#skyblockbuilder:additional_valid_spawns`.

### Offset
If the spawn height type is set to `range`, this offset will be used to slightly move the spawn height in any 
direction. Negative values go down, positive values go up.

## Radius
The radius to find a valid spawn if no given spawn point is valid.

Minimum: 0
