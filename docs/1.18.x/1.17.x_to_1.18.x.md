# Updating 1.17.x to 1.18.x

- [Removed biome range config](../1.17.x/config/world.md#biome-range) *will hopefully come back once I figured out how*
- Datapack format changed
    - biome source: 
        - "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_provider", "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_nether_provider" merged to "skyblockbuilder:multi_noise"
        - "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_end_provider" -> "skyblockbuilder:the_end"
    - chunk generator:
        - "skyblockbuilder:skyblock", "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_nether" and "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_nether" merged to "skyblockbuilder:noise_based"
- [Changed registry name for world type](packdev/packdev.md#main-setup) from "skyblockbuilder:custom_skyblock" -> "skyblockbuilder:skyblock"
- [Added cooldown for teleporting commands](config/utility.md#teleports)
- [Starting inventory](config/inventory.md#starting-inventory) nbt needs to be a string now
- [Starting inventory](config/inventory.md#starting-inventory) items now supports "ForgeCaps" (can't give an example)
- [Starting inventory](config/inventory.md#starting-inventory) will now be given when joining a team instead of only on first world join - but only once for each team!
- Teams/islands are now stored/accessible with team ids
- Changed [surface](config/world.md#surface) starting at world bottom instead of 0
- Islands will be generated based on the world height if the spawn dimension is set to "default" in config (dynamic height required, see below)

- You now can choose *any* dimension as [spawn dimension](config/spawn.md#dimension)
