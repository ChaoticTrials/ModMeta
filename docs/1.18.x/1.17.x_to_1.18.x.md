- Datapack format changed
    - biome source: 
        - removed completely
    - chunk generator:
        - "skyblockbuilder:skyblock", "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_nether" merged to "skyblockbuilder:noise_based"
        - "skyblockbuilder:skyblock_end" -> "skyblockbuilder:the_end"
- [Changed registry name for world type](packdev/packdev.md#main-setup) from "skyblockbuilder:custom_skyblock" -> "skyblockbuilder:skyblock"
- [Added cooldown for teleporting commands](config/utility.md#teleports)
- [Starting inventory](config/inventory.md#starting-inventory) nbt needs to be a string now
- [Starting inventory](config/inventory.md#starting-inventory) items now supports "ForgeCaps" (can't give an example)
- [Starting inventory](config/inventory.md#starting-inventory) will now be given when joining a team instead of only on first world join - but only once for each team!
- Teams/islands are now stored/accessible with team ids
- Changed [surface](config/world.md#surface) starting at world bottom instead of 0
- The [spawn height](config/spawn.md#height) is now a bit more complicated to set, but is more dynamic now
