# Main setup
## Setting world type on single player as default
You simply start the game once. It will generate a config called `forge-common.toml`. Change the only value in this
config to `skyblockbuilder:skyblock`, or use this example and create a file called `forge-common.toml` in the
config directory with this content:
```toml
[general]
	defaultWorldType = "skyblockbuilder:skyblock"
```

## Setting world type on server as default
If you want to provide a custom `server.properties` file, set the `level-type` to `skyblockbuilder:skyblock`.
Otherwise, it's the same as in [single player](#setting-world-type-on-single-player-as-default).

## Creating a custom skyblock island
1. Build an island.
2. Use the custom item `Structure Saver` from the vanilla Tools tab in creative inventory. The output directory for this
   is `<minecraft>/skyblock_exports/<name>.nbt`. If you set a Spawn Block, you'll also get an additional file with all
   the spawn points where the spawn blocks were. They are not present in the exported file. If you click the option to
   export everything into the config, the template will be generated into the correct directory. If you used spawn 
   blocks, spawns will also be added to `config/skyblockbuilder/templates.json5`.
   Alternatively, you can also use the vanilla Structure Block. Keep in mind that this can only save islands up to 
   48x48x48 blocks and the output is in `<minecraft>/saves/<world>/generated/minecraft/structures/<name>.nbt`.
3. Copy the generated file from its directory (see previous step) to `config/skyblockbuilder/templates/<name>.nbt`.
4. [Configure the template with a better readable name and spawns](#configuring-templates) in
   `config/skyblockbuilder/templates.json5`. There can be multiple spawns, each one is an array with `[x, y, z]`
   relative to the 0, 0, 0 from the template structure. You can also
   [modify existing spawns](../user/user.md#modify-spawns) and export them with `/skyblock spawns EXPORT`.
   IMPORTANT: You need to be in a world with world-type `Skyblock` to use the commands.
5. To view your current spawns, you need to run `/skyblock spawns debug` to view all possible spawn points.
6. To apply the new spawn points to your template, copy the exported spawn points (you need to open the file) into the
   file `config/skyblockbuilder/templates.json5` where needed.

## Setting a default spawn island
You can set a default spawn island for new worlds by setting `spawn`. If it's set to `null`, it will use the default
template used for new teams. For more information about the value for `spawn`, look at 
[Configuring templates](#configuring-templates).

## Setting multiple templates
You can set multiple schematics by putting them into `config/skyblockbuilder/templates/`. These schematics can the user 
use by pressing the `Customize` button in world options screen or changing the schematic with command 
`/skyblock manage islandShape <template>` where `<template>` is the name specified in 
[next chapter](#configuring-templates).

## Configuring templates
As described in [Creating a custom skyblock island](#creating-a-custom-skyblock-island), you can improve the readability
of templates and set the spawn points for each template in the config here: `config/skyblockbuilder/templates.json5`.
There you have 4 options. First the `spawns`:
```json
{
   "spawns": {
      "default": {
        "east": [],
        "west": [],
        "north": [],
        "south": [
          [ 6, 3, 5 ]
        ]
      }
   }
}
```
This option holds multiple objects. The key (here `default`) is important for the `templates` option in a next step.
You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that **no key** can be used twice! The content of each object are the
four directions as keys. These include an array of arrays. This array contains the spawn positions. The spawn positions 
are formatted this way:
```
[ x, y, z ]
```

Second, the `surroundingBlocks`:
```json
{
  "surroundingBlocks": {
    "default": [
      "minecraft:stone",
      "minecraft:bedrock"
    ]
  }
}
```
This options holds multiple objects. The key (here `default`) is important for the `templates` option in the next step.
You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that **no key** can be used twice! The content of each object is an
array of resource locations for blocks. These blocks will be used to surround the template with these blocks, randomly
selected. Look at the `surroundingMargin` in the next step for thickness.

Now the `templates`:
```json
{
   "templates": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "desc": "Default template",
      "file": "default.nbt",
      "spawns": "default",
      "offset": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
      "surroundingBlocks": "default",
      "surroundingMargin": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

- The `name` is the name displayed in the `Customize` screen when selecting the world-preset.
- The `desc` (optional - default "") is the description displayed in the `Customize` screen when selecting the world-type.
- The `file` is the name of the file for that template.
- The `spawns` is the spawn configuration name from the `spawns` option.
- The `direction` (optional - default "south") is the direction the user should look at for this template. If not 
  provided, it'll be `south`.
- The `offset` (optional - default [ 0, 0, 0 ]) is the offset for this specific template. Read 
  [here](../config/world.md#offset) more about the offset. This specific offset can also be set for x (first number) 
  and z (second number) separately.
- The `surroundingBlocks` (optional - default "") is the surrounding blocks configuration name from the 
  `surroundingBlocks` option.
- The `surroundingMargin` (optional - default 0) is the thickness for the border.
You can have the same file and the same spawns in multiple configurations. They all are only separated by the name.

You can also set an icon for each template. This is located in `config/skyblockbuilder/templates/icon/<name>.png`. The
name needs to be lowercase.

**NOTE**: If you spawn inside a block, you could add this block to the 
[block tag ðŸ”—](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack#Tags) 
`#skyblockbuilder:additional_valid_spawns`.

## Loot chests on island
If you want a loot chest on an island, you need to set the NBT data to the chest with the `/data merge block <x y z>
{LootTable: modid:path/to/loot_table}` command to set it as loot chest.

**WARNING**! Do not open that chest after merging this data into the chest.

## Convert existing templates from `.nbt` to `.snbt`
You can convert existing templates from `.nbt` to `.snbt` files with the command `/skyblock templates_to_snbt`. This
will convert all templates in the `config/skyblockbuilder/templates/` directory to `.snbt` files while keeping the
original `.nbt` files.
