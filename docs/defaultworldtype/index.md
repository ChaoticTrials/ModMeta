A client-only mod to pre-define world presets for modpacks.
When you start the game and navigate to the world creation screen, it will generate a file at 
`<instance>/config/defaultworldtype/world-types.txt` which contains all possible values for the config. You can choose
any value and set it in the config file. This world preset will be automatically selected when a player opens the world
creation screen.

This mod is mainly for modpack creators, normal users which want to combine a few mods don't need it. *Unless they want
to create a lot of worlds with a special world preset.
