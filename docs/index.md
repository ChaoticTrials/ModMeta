# Mod Wikis

Welcome to the home of explanation of ChaoticTrials' mods. Here you can find explanation about nearly everything.

Currently, this wiki page is still in development. That means, this will be filled with information one by one. If you
want to help to fill this wiki, you're free to create pull requests. You can always see which mod was even be started
to work on by looking at the left sidebar.

All the wikis here should target the latest version of the mod.

Currently, I'm working on overhauling this website. You can view the ongoing progress at
the [Chaotic Trials Staging Website](https://staging.chaotictrials.de/). Additionally, you can find the source code and
provide feedback [here](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/chaotictrials.github.io).

Below, you can find all mods with links to their wiki pages (even if they have a separate page), the CurseForge download
count (+ link to project), Modrinth download count (+ link to project), and link to GitHub repository.
